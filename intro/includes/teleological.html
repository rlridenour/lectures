## Paley ##

* Find watch on the ground
* Perceive that its parts seem arranged for a purpose
* Infer that the watch had a designer

## No need ##

* To have seen it made
* For it to run perfectly
* To completely understand it, etc.

## Hume's Criticisms ##

* Can infer no more cause than required for the effect
* Disorder in the world
* Universe and watch are infinitely different
* Cannot make inference from only one case

## The Teleological Argument ##

1. Cocks, poems, computers, and so on, exhibit apparent design and are produced by minds.
2. <u>The world exhibits apparent design.</u>  
The world was probably also produced by a mind.

## Arguments from Analogy ##

* Strong when
   * Sample is large
   * No known instances in sample that lack the property in question
   * No relevant dissimilarities between sample the object in question
* Weaker when these conditions are not met

### Argument from Analogy — Evaluation ###

* Large Sample
* No known instances of apparent design without actual design
* Some dissimilarities - are they relevant?

### An Inference to the Best Explanation ###

* State of affairs that requires explanation
* List possible explanations
* Rational to believe the most plausible explanation

	 </textarea> 
</section>

<section data-markdown> 
	 <textarea data-template> 

Possible explanations for apparent design:

1. Random chance
2. Evolution
3. Designer

#### Which is Most Plausible? ####

1. Evolution - too limited in scope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Chance - no explanation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Designer - only explanation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#### The Argument as a Probability Argument ####

* The probability of a hypothesis (H) is a function of
    * Prior probability: the initial plausibility of H
    * Predictive power: the probability of the evidence if the hypothesis is true

## Example

* Bedrock Bank robbed
* Hypotheses:
    * F: Fred did it.
    * B: Barney did it.
    </textarea>
    </section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
Background knowledge: Fred has a prior armed robbery conviction.

So, F has the higher prior probability — Pr(F) > Pr(B) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
Evidence: Burglary tools found in Barney's car, Swiss bank account newly opened in Barney's name, Barney found at airport with one-way ticket to....

B has the higher predictive power — Pr(B|E) > Pr(F|E) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

#### Evaluation of the Probability Argument ####

* Two hypotheses
    * Naturalism: Every fact is a natural fact and has a natural explanation.
    * Theism: God exists and caused the world to exist.
* Naturalism may have the higher prior probability.
* Theism has the higher predictive power.
* Predictive power trumps prior probability.
