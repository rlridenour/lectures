## Determinism and Freedom ##

* Incompatibilists believe that determinism is incompatible with freedom. If determinism is true, then no one is free.
* Compatibilists believe that determinism and freedom are compatible.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Incompatibilism ##

* Incompatibilism includes hard determinism and libertarianism.
* Hard determinists believe that determinism is true and people are therefore never free.
* Libertarians believe that determinism is false and people are at least sometimes free.
* Both agree that freedom is incompatible with determinism.

## Compatibilism ##

* Compatibilists believe that determinism is true, but people are still sometimes free. How?

<!-- ## Van Inwagen on Freedom ## -->

<!-- ### Consequence Argument ### -->

<!-- 1. If determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws of nature and events in the remote past.  -->
<!-- 2. It is not up to us what went on before we born -->
<!-- 3. It is not up to us what the laws of nature are. -->
<!-- 4. If A is not up to us, and A entails B, then B is not up to us. (No Choice Principle) -->
<!-- 5. If determinism is true, then our acts are not up to us. -->
<!-- 6. If our acts are not up to us, then the are not free. -->
<!-- 7. Therefore, if determinism is true, then we are not free. -->

<!-- ## Mind Argument ## -->

<!-- 1. If an act is not determined, then it is uncaused. -->
<!-- 2. Uncaused acts are a result of chance. -->
<!-- 3. Events that occur by chance are not under the control of anyone -->
<!-- 4. If an act is not under the control of anyone, it cannot be performed freely. -->
<!-- 5. If an act is not not determined, then it cannot be performed freely. -->

## Problems
 
* People have to shift attention from intention to clock.
* Maybe we don't generally act freely.
* Maybe there's a decision to act before decision how to act.
* Maybe a condition has to hold before we act.
