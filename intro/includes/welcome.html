    <aside class="notes">God has given each of you certain gifts and talents. You probably know what some of them are. You'll identify others during your time at OBU. Some of you have a talent for philosophical thought. My job is to help you cultivate it. Others of you may not have that talent. My job is to help you get better at it — because you will have a better life if you can think well.  </aside>

    <h1>Secrets for Success!</h1>
</section>

<!-- No food or drink -->
<section data-background-image="./images/food.jpg" >  <aside class="notes">Not my rule. You can choose to follow it or not. If you choose not to follow the rule, here's what will happen. The dean of the business school will report it to my dean. I will then get in trouble with my dean, which will make me angry, then I go to my office and make up your exam.</aside> </section>


<!-- Be prepared -->
<section data-background-image="./images/play-dough.jpeg" >  <aside class="notes">To succeed you need to be here. You won't be able to just read the text and pass the exams. Being here, though, means more than just showing up. Be present, be ready — don't be like this guy. When I say something stupid, you're welcome to laugh at me. The fact that you laughed shows that you listened. Two things I don't like: sleeping in class and having conversations while I'm talking. It's disrespectful, don't do it.</aside> </section>


<!-- Electronic Devices -->
<section data-background-image="https://media2.giphy.com/media/yDq2e3gYslajC/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611e5b7dba4d8e31cc8a105fa4ecd11297661e1fc6d&rid=giphy.gif"> <aside class="notes">I don't ban electronic devices. We may use them for polls and for some learning checks. Research is showing that taking notes on computers is not ideal for learning. Don't be doing something on your device while in this class that has nothing to do with the class. Don't think you're fooling anybody.</aside></section>

<!-- Ask questions -->
<section data-background-image="https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2JdWxzgZMizJ1DuU/giphy.gif?cid=790b76116a99284c7077fea41cb9eaf28d5555237d244f9f&rid=giphy.gif"> <aside class="notes">You've heard it said that the only dumb question is an unasked quetion. That's not exactly true. Do ask quetions. If you don't understand something, then odds are most of the class doesn't either. The more you engage the ideas the better you will do.</aside></section>

<!-- Office hours -->
<section data-background-image="https://media0.giphy.com/media/tXL4FHPSnVJ0A/giphy.gif?cid=790b76111168518596172dbfad7d643a2db7ea909e1dd265&rid=giphy.gif"><aside class="notes">I will help you — come to office hours, those lonely, lonely office hours. Just stop in and say hello.</aside></section>

<!-- Academic integrity -->
<section data-background-image="https://media0.giphy.com/media/l4pTju6aRosO0ZUOI/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611b87bc3305e8ce18f9f65052a5c2f31fbefb9fe4b&rid=giphy.gif"><aside class="notes">The student handbook defines academic misconduct. For us, academic integrity means doing your own work. Don't cheat on exams, don't get papers from the internet. If you use a source, then cite it. (An exception is the apology paper.)</aside></section>

<!-- Have fun! -->

Maybe not this much fun, but we will have fun. Engage the material, enjoy it, and the grade tends to work out fine.</aside></section>
